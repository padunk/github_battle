# Github Battle
This is my first React Project from www.reacttraining.com<br>
I am not using create-react-app yet, so this is using old boilerplate React.<br>
The app is about battle between Github user based on Followers and Star Repo.<br>
>Warning: No ES6

## Usage
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Running demo can be found at [Github-Battle-Demo](https://react-training-3db98.firebaseapp.com)

## Something Missing?

If you have any ideas or feedbacks on this project, please let me know.<br>
Thank you!
